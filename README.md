# My-Second-Project
KEYPOINTS USED ARE- HTML,CSS,MADE IT RESPONSIVE
In my second project apart from making an online food delivery service i tried making it responsive for all the devices.
In this project i have provided a navigation bar along with some information about the Service, i have used dummy text here for now, along with that i have shown the services which will be provided for ex- Food Catering, Mass Ordering and Food Ordering. After that i have added the clients section that consist of the clients that are connected to us like instagram,facebook and apple.
After that a form is given which will include the information of user like name, email, text and number.
At last i have added the copyright statement and made my website more alive using RESPONSIVE property.
